# What values do the following expressions have?
# answer = numbers[0]           # 3
# answer = numbers[-1]          # 2
# answer = numbers[3]           # 1

# answer = 5 in numbers         # True
# answer = 7 in numbers         # False

# answer = numbers + [6, 5, 3]  # [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]

# Write Python expressions to achieve the following:
# numbers[0] = "ten"        # 1. Change the first element of numbers to "ten"
# numbers[-1] = 1           # 2. Change the last element of numbers to 1
# answer = numbers[2:]      # 3. Get all the elements from numbers except the first two
# answer = 9 in numbers     # 4. Check if 9 is an element of numbers

# print(answer)
# print(numbers)
